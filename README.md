# 3D Neuron Visualization

This project is an interactive 3D visualization of a neuron using Python and Matplotlib. It includes dendrites, an axon, a soma, myelin sheath, and synaptic connections.

## Features
- Realistic 3D rendering of neuron components.
- Interactive visualization with rotation and zoom.
- Axes labeled in micrometers (Âµm) for realistic scaling.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/3d-neuron-visualization.git
